        Trinity Gray is a North Carolina native who began pursuing her passion for writing at a very young age when her older sister introduced her to the idea of keeping a journal at about eleven years old. 
        For the following years, writing was simply an emotional release for Trinity who had never imagined that she would eventually pursure becoming a published author. 
        It was until speaking with her close family and friends about jarring issues within their personal lives that she began referencing some of her writing to them as guidance. 
        It was not long before friends and family were in awe of her work. Up until those moments, Trinity never recognized her writing to be worth publishing. 
        So, inspired by the support of her loved ones, she gathered years worth of journaling to create what is now Love Letters to the Underdog.
